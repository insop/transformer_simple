# Implement Transformer (TODO reference) with C

Implement Tranformer with C to understand the internal operations, so it is intentionally implemented for readablilty than optimality

# Build

```
cd sml
make
cd ..

cd src
make

```

# Run

```
cd src
./transformer

```

# TODO:
- have a main Makefile
- add config load
- add trained weight load
- add python code to generate test vector, and use that to test the C code
